Quiz Master


Quiz master is a cli appliation that mimics quiz games but in the cli(as the name implies)

I implemented this function by writing a single function which makes use of predefined questions and allows an interactive session with the user.

This application allows the user to choose the criterion and difficulty of the quiz questions
